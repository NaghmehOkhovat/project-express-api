# Project Express API

BooksData API built in Node using Express. The task was to create an API with different endpoints. The API uses a static data set stored as a JSON-file.

My Routes:
        "/": "Welcome Page to API BookData",
	 		  "/books": "All books",
        "/books/author": "authors in alphabetic order",
        "/books/:id/": "Search books by BookID",
